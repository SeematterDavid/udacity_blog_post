## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No particularly requisite libraries to run the code beyond the routine Anaconda distribution of Python. Python versions 3.* should work without any issues.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of Udacity Nanodegree project, I have decided to use Antwerpen 2020 Airbnb dataset.

As part of analysing the Antwerpen Airbnb data I would like to focus on the simple matter, whether it is always suitable to run a linear regression model in order to predict the Airbnb prices with the given data at hand.

Key Questions I would focus upon - 
Is it reasonable to include the minimum of nights, the availability or the number of reviews given in a linear model to predict prices? 
What are reasonable geograpical groups of Airbnb objects in Antwerpen? 
Is it possible to predict prices of air bnb objects with the data and model at hand?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

'listings_antwerpen.csv' contains Antwerpen 2020 airbnb data 'antwerpen_analysis.ipynb' notebook showcsaes the overall work and the flow to derive answers for the 3 business Questions I am focussing upon.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The key conclusions of the analysis are available at the ***POST*** available
